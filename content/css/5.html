    <h2><strong>FlexBox</strong> </h2>

    <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model,
        and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
        When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one
        dimension at a time â€” either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS
        Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>
