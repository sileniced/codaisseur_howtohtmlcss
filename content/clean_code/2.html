  <h2>DRY, KISS and Separation of concerns</h2>

    <p>There are various acronyms and terms that developers use which might seem confusing at first but are good to stick to.
    More notable ones are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)-DRY refers to code writing methodology.
        DRY usually refers to code duplication.
        If we write the same logic more than once, we should “DRY up our code.”</li>
      <li>KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) - Keeping it simple surpsingly hard.
        Usually when someone tries to over-engineer a soluiton to a problem.
        For example an Architect suggests creating a Microservice framework for a simple website.
        The Engineer will then say: “Let’s KISS it and do something simpler”.</li>
      <li>Separation of concerns - Another something we need to keep reminder ourselves is to do just one thing.
        As developers we apparently want to “do all the things” with every function, class or object we create.</li>
    </ul>
