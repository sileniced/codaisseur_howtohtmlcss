<h2><strong>Refactioring</strong> </h2>

<p>Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.
   Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity;
   these can improve source-code maintainability and create a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.
   Typically, refactoring applies a series of standardised basic micro-refactorings, each of which is (usually) a tiny change in a computer
   program's source code that either preserves the behaviour of the software, or at least does not modify its conformance to functional requirements.
   Many development environments provide automated support for performing the mechanical aspects of these basic refactorings.
   If done extremely well, code refactoring may help software developers discover and fix hidden or dormant bugs or vulnerabilities
   in the system by simplifying the underlying logic and eliminating unnecessary levels of complexity.
   If done poorly it may fail the requirement that external functionality not be changed, introduce new bugs, or both.</p>
