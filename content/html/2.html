<h2><strong> Tags & Attributes</strong></h2>

<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are elements of the HTML document used to specify how the document should be displayed by the browser.
    In HTML, each tag has its own specific meaning, which is (in general) common across all different browsers.
    In fact, you may think of this tutorial as an introduction to the tags that are commonly used in writing HTML.</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>Attributes are associated with each tag to further define the tags.
    The general syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>tag attribute 1 = "value" attribute 2 = "value" ...</li>
</ul>
